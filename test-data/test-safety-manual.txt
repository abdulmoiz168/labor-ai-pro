ELECTRICAL SAFETY MANUAL FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS

Chapter 1: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

All electricians must wear proper PPE when working with electrical systems. This includes:
- Insulated gloves rated for the voltage being worked on
- Safety glasses with side shields
- Hard hat with electrical rating
- Non-conductive footwear with electrical hazard rating
- Flame-resistant clothing when working on energized equipment

Chapter 2: Lockout/Tagout Procedures

Before working on any electrical equipment:
1. Notify all affected employees
2. Shut down the equipment using normal stopping procedures
3. Isolate the energy source by opening disconnects or removing fuses
4. Apply lockout/tagout devices - each worker must apply their own lock
5. Release or block any stored energy (capacitors, springs, elevated parts)
6. Verify isolation by testing with a voltage tester

Chapter 3: Grounding Requirements

Proper grounding is essential for electrical safety:
- All metal enclosures must be grounded
- Ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI) required for temporary power
- Grounding electrode system must be installed per NEC requirements
- Equipment grounding conductor must be sized per NEC Table 250.122
- Test grounding resistance annually - must be less than 25 ohms

Chapter 4: Working at Heights

When working on overhead electrical systems:
- Use properly rated ladders - fiberglass for electrical work
- Maintain 10-foot clearance from power lines (50kV or less)
- Use fall protection equipment rated for electrical work
- Inspect all equipment before each use
- Never work alone when at heights above 6 feet

Chapter 5: Arc Flash Protection

Arc flash hazards require special precautions:
- Perform arc flash hazard analysis before work
- Wear proper arc-rated clothing based on incident energy level
- Use insulated tools rated for the voltage
- Establish flash protection boundary per NFPA 70E
- Only qualified workers may perform work within flash boundary

Chapter 6: Emergency Procedures

In case of electrical emergency:
- Call 911 immediately for medical emergencies
- Do not touch victim until power is confirmed off
- Use non-conductive materials to move victim if necessary
- Perform CPR if qualified and victim has no pulse
- Report all incidents to supervisor immediately
- Preserve accident scene for investigation

Chapter 7: Tool Safety

Electrical tools must be properly maintained:
- Inspect tools daily before use
- Use only double-insulated or grounded tools
- Keep tools dry and clean
- Replace damaged cords immediately
- Use GFCI protection on all portable tools
- Store tools properly to prevent damage
